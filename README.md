# Myth Mapper (Working Title)

This is an updated verison of my solo React App Project for Juno College - The Hero's Journey.

This app will have essentially the same functionality but greatly expanded. The goal of the App is to offer analysis of and guidance through the steps of the Hero's Journey, whether for writers, students or anyone curiouos.

The original App provided two sample heros to choose from for example text and walked the user through the 12 step version of the Hero's Journey. It then displayed the user's entries on a vertical timeline that the user was able to edit inline and saved the entries to a realtime database on Firebase.

## New Version

The new version of the app will expand the original with the following features

- 5 Example Heros to choose from for Example Text
- The ability for the user to name their hero and save multiple heros on their profile
- Updated UI which allows the user to navigate to any step of the journey at any time, rather than the current "Quiz" style
- The ability to change which example hero is active on the fly
- The ability to toggle which version of the Hero's Journey the user wishes to explore. Be it Campbell's original 17 step or the more common 12, it will also provide an example of the "Save the Cat" version and a "Heroine's Journey"
- The App will feature an about page for each version of the Hero's Journey, with history, criticism, etc
- The App will allow the user to designate their antagonists (Shadows) and allies (Mentors, Allies) and recommend where the user should mention and implement these secondary characters.
- The App will give the user a choice of how to display their hero's journey, as a cycle, a horizontal, or a vertical timeline. 
-The ability for the user to export their input as a printable document or save it as a pdf etc.

The reason I am restarting instead of just expanding on the previous app is I have learned so much about React since the original project and it would probably be more work to try and refactor as opposed to starting fresh with a better perspective.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
